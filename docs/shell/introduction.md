# 0. Introduction

As front-end developers, there are few chances to get in touch with shell scripts, as we spend most of our time dealing with HTML, CSS, javascript, etc.

However, when we are levelling up, we would realize some places where they have to use shell scripts to do kinds of stuff, such as git hooks, code compiling, and deployments.

If you, like me, easily got confused to study shell scripting for the first time, then I hope this document can kill your headache ðŸ˜€.
